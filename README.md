There are two data files:

adult.train contains about 32,000 training instances, one instance per line in comma-separated value (csv) format. Each line contains 14 fields. The first 13 fields correspond to the features listed above, the final field denotes the class label

adult.test is formatted exactly like adult.train, and contains about 16,000 further instances for evaluation.

'?' denotes an unknown value, this project will treat it as just another value for its feature.
